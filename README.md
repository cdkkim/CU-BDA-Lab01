## Motivation for taking this course
I want to discover as many meaningful information as possible from any data to gain knowledge of the world we live in and use this information to make valuable changes. I believe that the more techniques you have, the more you will get from the same event. I want to see the data from the Baysian perspective.

## Description of data analysis problem
Airline ticket prices vary on many factors, and one of them is the number of days before flight. Although it is generally true that the ticket price is higher when it is closer to the departure date, the ticket price is not necessarily cheaper when the departure date is far away. Then, what is the number of days before flight that gives the lowest airline ticket price?

## Image of the problem
Image below illustrates average low fare vs the number of days before flight.
