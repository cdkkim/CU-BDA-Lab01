### Interest
I am interested in data analytics. but I believe this happens not just truly understanding the data but using the right data for the problem. 

### Hobby
I like to play tennis. Started playing since 2009. My high school varsity team went runner-up in 2011 and I played number 4 in the team. My favorite player is Roger Federer.

I also play acoustic guitar when I have free time.
